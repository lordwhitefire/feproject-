Egusi colosynthis citrullus lanatus is a West African melon. Agushi, agusi and egushi are other names for this fruit. The melon's flesh is bitter and inedible; only the seeds of the fruit are eaten. Egusi seeds are high in protein and their flavor is said to be close to that of pumpkin seeds. Each seed is oval shaped and whitish in color with a light tan shell. The shelled seeds are ground for use in Nigerian recipes ‚Äî especially the popular egusi soup

This recipe will show you how to make Nigerian Egusi Soup, a popular West African soup made with melon seeds.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Egusi seeds: Egusi (melon seeds) are usually sold in African stores. I use roughly 2 cups for this recipe.</li>
<li>
Meat: African soups are mostly cooked with an assortment of meat like beef, goat meat, cow feet, or tripe (shaki). For this recipe, I use goat meat and cow feet but you can really add any type of meat you want to.
</li>
<li>
Vegetables: Tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, habanero peppers, and spinach. The traditional Egusi soup is made with scotch bonnet peppers but if you're in the U.S, habanero peppers make a great substitute.
</li>
<li>
Palm Oil: Palm oil gives a rich, traditional taste to this soup but you can use olive oil if that is what you have on hand.
</li>
<li>
Smoked catfish: This is made from catfish that has been dried and smoked and is used to flavor a lot of Nigerian dishes. It gives a really unique traditional taste and flavor. You can omit this if you don‚Äôt have any.
</li>
<li>
Spices: For Egusi soup, I use ground crayfish, salt, cayenne pepper, and bouillon (Maggi cubes). I also use black pepper to boil the meat.
</li>
<li>
Broth/Stock: You can use water if you have none but you will need to add more spices.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 >steps on how to prepare egusi soup</h2>
<h3 >preparations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
Egusi seeds are usually blended before cooking and this can be easily done using a food processor, nutribullet blender, or coffee grinder.
</li>
<li>
You do not add water when blending, but as you blend you would notice the consistency changes to a somewhat powdery paste. You can buy the actual seeds or buy them pre-ground.
</li>
  <li>
Start by prepping the vegetables, meat, and dried smoked catfish. 
</li>
<li>
Prepare the meat: Boil the meat you want to use. I used goat meat and cow feet. You can use any beef of your choice. To use goat meat or beef, add the meat to the pot and add just enough water to cover it.
</li>
<li>
Add about a tablespoon of salt and black pepper and boil for 30-40 minutes till the meat is tender.
</li>
<li>
Prepare the dried smoked catfish: Soak the dried catfish in hot water for about 10 minutes and break it into small pieces. Remove as many pieces of bones as you can and rinse under running water.
</li>
<li>
Prepare the vegetables: Blend the tomatoes, bell pepper, and habanero peppers using a food processor with minimal water added. 
</li>
<li>
If the blended mixture looks watery, pour it into a bot and let it boil for about 10 minutes, until it becomes a bit thicker.
</li>
<li>
Chop the onions and spinach and set them aside.
</li>
</ul>
<h3> cooking my egusi soup </h3>

  <div>
<ol >
<li> Add palm oil to a pot on medium heat. When it gets hot, add the chopped onions.
</li>
<li>
Add the blended tomato, bell pepper, and habanero pepper to the palm oil and stir for a few minutes.
</li>
<li>
Then add your smoked fish and let cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes.
</li>
<li>
Add the meat and broth if you have some on hand, if not just add water. When it boils, add your ground egusi seeds and stir.
</li>
<li>
At this point, different tribes in Nigeria have their own spin on how to add the Egusi seeds. The Yorubas like to chop onions, mix with the egusi, and form balls, before adding them.
</li>
<li>
I didn't use onions but I just formed balls and placed them into the mixture. Stir a few minutes carefully and slowly and let simmer on medium heat.
</li>
<li>
Add the goat meat and cow feet or whatever meat you have on hand. Add ground crayfish, salt, pepper, and bouillon powder. Let it cook for another 10 minutes on medium-high heat.
</li>
<li>
Lastly, add the chopped spinach. I use fresh spinach here but you can also use frozen
</li>
<li>
The spinach should be added at the end because you don‚Äôt want it to overcook and become wilted in the soup. Leave on low heat for 5-10 minutes.
</li>
<li>
I make different versions, sometimes with a lot of leafy greens and sometimes barely any, depending on my mood or what I have available in the house. It still comes out tasting great!
</li>
</ol>

Nigerian Egusi soup goes great with fufu dishes, though it can also be eaten with garri ,semovita or wheat üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
