      <p>
        The nigerian vegetable sauce is what i think came from someone who maybe wanted to make use of leftover vegetables (especially people that cook in large quantities .Things like salad and so, tends to bring about some left over ) .Or wanted to create a food that specializes more on vegetables .In nigeria especially most food do not focus heavily on vegetables unlike countries like korea e.t.c Infact as we speak most vegetarians in nigeria are as a result of health problems or old age though there are pure vegetarians, they are just too few as nigeria is a purely non vegetarian country.
        </p>
        <p>
          vegetable sauce is a healthy and rich alternative to the everyday tomato based beef or chicken stew .It contains a lot of nutrients and will help us to avoid health deficiency issues
I love to prepare this mixed vegetable sauce whether or not i find a lot of vegetables

<ol>
  <li>
Wash and cut the whole chicken into pieces. Place in a pot, add chopped spring onions, stock cubes and thyme. Add water to cover the contents of the pot and start cooking.
  </li>
  <li>
When done, add salt to taste and top up the water to the same level as the contents if necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
Once it boils, add the chopped tomatoes and the vegetable oil. Cover and cook for 15 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
Add the carrots and cook for 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
Now, add the potato puree, chopped bell peppers and cabbage. Stir, cover and allow to cook for 5 minutes on high heat. Add salt to taste and the sauce is ready to be served.
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
Note: Feel free to experiment by varying the thickness of the vegetable sauce. This you can achieve by increasing or decreasing the amount of potato puree added till you get a consistency that appeals to you.
</p>
<p>
Tip: The smoothest puree usually settles at the bottom so you may want to use only that (if it is sufficient) and discard the frothy part at the top.
