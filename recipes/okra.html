Nigerian Okra soup is simply a stewed okra soup recipe. It is a very popular delicacy among the  Yoruba ethnic group of western Nigeria. Okra Soup is one of the quickest and easiest Nigerian soups to prepare.

 <p>
Just like ogbono soup and Ewedu soup, Okro soup has a viscous texture which makes it an acquired taste. Talking about Ogbono soup – this is a thick delicious, and hearty soup made from the Wild mango seeds, and it has a ton of nutritional benefits.

800 grams Assorted Meats (Shaki, Ponmo, Cowfoot, Beef, Goat meat and offals are ideal)
</li>
  <li>
2-3 Pieces Stock Fish
</li>
  <li>
2 Medium Smoked Fish
</li>
  <li>

</li>
  <li>

</li>
  <li>
1 Cooking Spoon Crayfish
</li>
  <li>
2-3  Scotch Bonnet (Atarodo)

</li>
  <li>
1/2 Cooking Spoon Cayenne Pepper (Ata gungun)
</li>
  <li>

  </ul>

Firstly, blend 1/3 of the Okra and chop the rest. If you want it chunky with no elasticity, you can chop the, all or blend all if you don’t fancy any chunkiness. I prefer mine both ways. Clean the smoked fish and soak in hot water to remove all traces of dirt, shred and set aside.
</li>
 <li>
Boil the meats on medium to high heat with the chopped onion, Knorr Cubes,  garlic and salt to taste. Start with tougher meats like Shaki, Cow foot, Ponmo, add softer meats as you go. If you’re using stock fish, add with the softer meats…
</li>
 <li>
You’ll need to season your meats really well . If your stock isn’t well seasoned, then your soup may end up tasting bland. Ensure you end up with very rich and tasty stock. You’ll need at least 5 cups of stock left in the pot after boiling the meats so, ensure you add enough water.
</li>
 <li>
When the meats are soft, transfer the meats into a bowl, leaving just the stock in the pot. Add the palm oil and leave to boil on medium heat for 6-8 minutes…
</li>
 <li>
Now add the ground pepper, then the locust beans…
</li>
 <li>
Add the ground crayfish, then the chopped peppers
</li>
 <li>
Leave to cook for 3 minutes. Now add the blended okra. Stir vigorously to combine…..
 <li>
Now add the shredded smoked fish, smoked prawns, cooked meats and smoked fish back into the pot. Stir and combine then add the chopped okra…
</li>
 <li>
Add the fresh prawns if you’re using any, leave to cook for 5 minutes…
</li>
 <li>
And it’s ready.

</ol>


<p>Serve with any swallow of your choice, I love mine with white or yellow Garri (Eba)
