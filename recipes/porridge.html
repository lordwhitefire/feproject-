Yam porridge  is another delicious Nigerian yam dish cooked in a well-seasoned pepper mix until soft and fluffy with some yam chunks. It is very quick and easy to make. It makes a perfect dinner or lunch and it is also a party favourite.
</p>
<p>
Yam porridge/ Pottage is one of the Nigerian delicacies that I love so much with an amazing taste. This yam porridge/ pottage recipe is absolutely delicious especially when you carefully choose the right ingredients for a rich and better taste.
</p>
<p>
Most people prefer to have their yam porridge/ Pottage garnish with some fresh leafy greens like spinach, scent leaves, and Kale for more nutritional value and taste while some people prefer to have it plain. I love the former so much because of its richness but whichever way you choose; with or without are both yummy.

<h2>ingredients for a rich and better taste</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
african yam : yam comes in 
different species, but the best one for this recipe is African yam.
</li>
  <li>
Red Bell Pepper, tomato, and habanero pepper: the blend of these three will make a perfect pepper mix for the porridge. 
</li>
  <li>
Fresh Palm Oil:  Fresh palm oil gives it the color and makes it fluffy.

<h2>
how to make your yam porridge</h2>
<ol>
 <li>
Peel and cut and rinse the yam. Ensure that you rinse the yam more than once until the water is clear and no longer cloudy. The yam should be in medium-sized chunks about 2 inches thick.
</li>
 <li>
Blend your pepper mix. Blend the bell pepper, habanero, tomato, and half onion.
</li>
 <li>
Cook the yam and the pepper mix together. Put the first yams inside a pot, and add the pepper mix, salt, bouillon powder, and water. Cover and let it cook for 10 minutes on medium to high heat.
</li>
 <li>
Stir in the Palm oil, sliced onions, and crayfish. Cover again and let it cook extra 10 minutes.
</li>
 <li>
Mash the yams. You can use a potato masher or a wooden spoon. I love to mash some yams and keep some chunks. It gives more texture!
</li>
 <li>
Add the fish. You can smoke fish, dried, boiled, canned, or stockfish. You can also add smoked turkey or any other meat you prefer.
</li>
 <li>
Simmer for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.
</li>
 <li>
Stir in the herbs or any other leafy vegetable of your choice.
Serve and enjoy while still hot!
