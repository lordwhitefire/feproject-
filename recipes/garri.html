Garri, otherwise known as Cassava Flakes, is one of the main sources of carbohydrates and a popular staple food in Nigeria. It is a local delicacy eaten across Nigeria, usually mixed with sugar, milk, etc and eaten however you desire.
</p>
      <p>
it  is a fine to coarse granular flour of varying texture made from cassava tubers (the root of the  cassava plant), which are cleaned after harvesting and grated. The water and starch are squeezed out and it is left to ferment. It is then fried and eaten in various ways. One way is to drink it; simply add water to the grains, stir, and there you have it. People often add sugar, groundnut oil or milk to it, making it a balanced meal or snack. Another way is to make it into a dough and cook it in hot water and eat it with a wide variety of sauces. It is also called gari or gali in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
